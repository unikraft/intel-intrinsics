# Intel (x86) intrinsics for Unikraft

This is a port of the headers providing compiler intrinsics for x86 architectures.
A list of these intrinsics can be browsed at [Intel Intrinsics](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html).
Normally you would receive these headers together with your compiler, however, due to Unikraft's isolated build environment, we provide them explicitly.

Please refer to `README.md` in the main unikraft repository as well as the [Unikraft Homepage](https://unikraft.org/) for further information.
